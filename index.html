        <h4 class="text-center">CLEANING AS A MEANS TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS</h4><br><br>
        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Introduction</h5><br>
    </div>
    
    <p>COVID-19 has been proven to survive on some surfaces for up to 16 hours, making it important to regularly disinfect your surroundings, <span class="font-italic">i.e.
    </span> frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, staircase supports, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps and sinks.
    Products containing bleach, alcohol or hydrogen peroxide are the best at killing off germs.</p><br>

    <div class="heading-two">
        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">A closer look at bleach</h5><br>
    </div>
    <p>Bleach is a strong and effective disinfectant. Its active ingredient, <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">sodium hypochlorite</span>  is effective in killing bacteria, fungi and viruses, but it is easily inactivated by organic material. Diluted household bleach disinfects within 10â€“60 minutes contact time and is recommended for surface disinfection.</p>
    <p>However, bleach irritates mucus membranes, the skin and the airways, decomposes under heat and light and reacts easily with other chemicals, therefore should be used with caution. Ventilation should be adequate and consistent with relevant occupational health and safety guidance.</p>
    <p>Improper use of bleach, including deviation from recommended dilutions (either stronger or weaker), may reduce its effectiveness for disinfection and can cause injury. Thus, make dilute bleach solution as needed and use it within 24 hours, as its disinfecting ability fades with time. Non-porous items can be immersed in bleach for 30 seconds.</p><br><br>

        <h5 class="text-primary text-center font-weight-bold">Procedure for making and using diluted bleach</h5><br>
        
        <div class="procedure ml-3">
            <li>Mix bleach with cold water by using 5 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water. Note: <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Hot water decomposes the sodium hypochlorite and renders it ineffective.</span></li><br>
            <li>Remember to use a mask, rubber gloves and waterproof apron. Goggles also are recommended to protect the eyes from splashes.</li><br>
            <li>Use bleach solutions in well-ventilated areas.</li><br>

    </ol><br><br>

    <div class="vinegar">
        <p class="text-center">Note: <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Vinegar and other natural products are not recommended as they do not serve the intended purpose.</span></p><br><br><br>

    <div class="electrolytic-process">
        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Electrolytic process in making bleach
        </h5><br>
        <h6 class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Raw materials</h6><br>
        <p>The raw materials for making household bleach are <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">chlorine</span> , <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">caustic soda</span> and <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">water</span>. The chlorine and caustic soda are produced by putting direct current electricity through a sodium chloride salt solution in a process called <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">electrolysis</span>. Sodium chloride (common table salt), comes from either mines or underground wells. The salt is dissolved in hot water to form a salt solution, which is then treated for impurities before it is reacted in the electrolytic cell.</p><br><br>
    </div><br>

    <ol class="jumbotron">
        <h5 class="text-primary text-center font-weight-bold">The manufacturing process
        </h5><br>
        <div class="ml-3">
            <li>Caustic soda is produced as a concentrated 50% solution which is diluted with water to form a new 25% solution.</li><br>

            <li>Heat is created when the water dilutes the strong caustic soda solution. The diluted caustic soda is cooled before it is reacted.</li><br> 

            <li>Chlorine and the caustic soda solution are reacted to form sodium hypochlorite bleach. This reaction can take place in a batch of about 14,000 gallons or in a continuous reactor.</li><br>

            <li>The bleach solution is then cooled to help prevent decomposition.</li><br>
            
            <li>The cooled bleach is settled or filtered to remove impurities that can discolor the bleach or catalyze its decomposition.</li><br>

            <li>The finished sodium hypochlorite bleach is shipped to a bottling plant or bottled on-site. Household-strength bleach is typically 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in an aqueous solution.</li><br>

    <ol class="jumbotron">
        <h5 class="text-primary text-center font-weight-bold">Precautionary measures to be taken</h5><br>
        <div class="precautions ml-3">
            <li>Using different bleach/cleaning agents at the same time could lead to emission of poisonous gases which, if inhaled too much over time, could cause respiratory complications or even death. If necessary, use detergents first, and rinse thoroughly with water before using bleach for disinfection.</li><br>
            <li>Bleach solutions are very hard on the skin, and should not be used as a substitute for handwashing and/or hand sanitizer.</li><br>
            <li>Check to ensure the product is not past its expiry date, otherwise it will not be effective in germ-killing.</li><br>
            <li>Avoid touching the eyes. If bleach gets into the eyes, immediately rinse with water for at least 15 minutes, and consult a physician.</li><br>
            <li>Undiluted bleach emits a toxic gas when exposed to sunlight, hence, store bleach in a cool, shaded place, out of the reach of children.</li><br>
            <li>Organic materials inactivate bleach. clean surfaces so that they are clear of organic materials before disinfection with bleach.</li><br>
            <li>If using diluted bleach, prepare the diluted solution fresh daily. Label and date it, and discard unused mixtures 24 hours after preparation.</li><br>
            <li>Keep diluted bleach covered and protected from sunlight, and if possible in a dark container, and out of child-reach.</li><br>
        </div>
        
    </ol><br><br>

    <div class="downside">
        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">The downside of using bleach in the fight against COVID-19</h5><br>
        <p>According to Jane Greatorex, a Virologist, using bleach is like <span class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">'using a bludgeon to swat a fly'</span>. To put it in simpler terms, it is not as effective in the fight against germs or viruses, case in point, coronavirus.</p>
        <p>Additonally, it has been proven that if you put bleach on a surface with a lot of dirt, that (dirt) will eat up the bleach. As such, it has been recommended that the use of milder soaps like dish washing soap is more fruitful in sanitizing indoor and outdoor surfaces.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Conclusion</h5><br>
        <p>As it has been stated by medical practioners, both locally and globally, the use of regular soap is just as effective in the fight against COVID-19. Bleach has demonstrated effects which if used in concentrated amounts, could corrode metal surface and pose harm to people with undelying respiratory complications.
